## Pull Request Approval Process ✅

To clarify our code review workflow, one simple rule applies:

- **Posting an image or GIF in the discussion of a Pull Request is considered an explicit approval of the PR.**

A few clarifications:
- Use this method only if you agree with the proposed changes. If you have concerns, leave a written comment explaining them instead.
- If you need to revoke your approval, clearly state that in a comment (for example "Approval revoked"); posting an image does not remove an approval.
- For critical changes, favor a formal review (the "Approve" button on GitHub) or a detailed written review.

Thank you for following this convention to improve communication and speed up our reviews.
